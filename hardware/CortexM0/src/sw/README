If Keil MDK-ARM µVision is well intalled on your computer :

1° Open the windows command line (Start > Execute > cmd)

2° Use the "cd" (change directory command to go to the Keil's installation directory,
   into the "ARM\ARMCC\bin" folder. By default, it is :

	"C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ARMCC\bin"

   so you "just" have to type :

	cd C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ARMCC\bin

   hint : use the TAB after having type the first letter(s) of a folder to go faster 

3° Use ARM's software "fromelf" to convert your ".axf" file (µVision project output : the memory image) 
   into an hexadecimal file, by typing the following command :

	fromelf ELEC2570-CM0-HelloWorld.axf --vhx --32x1 --output code.hex

4° Paste the produced hexa file "code.hex" into your "src/sw" directory (the first one). It will be loaded
   in the demo project that you have to run
